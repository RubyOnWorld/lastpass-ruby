- Make tests more consistent. Currently there's a lot of different binary blobs stored in the tests.
It would be good to generate the test data from some meaningful pieces. Like construct chunks from
items, construct items themselves. Build the whole blob out of chunks. This way the tests would be
more readable and easier to update in case of format changes. This also fixes the problem of
exposing real world usernames, passwords and encryption keys.
